# aws\_instance

Provides an EC2 instance resource. This allows instances to be created, updated,
and deleted. Instances also support [provisioning](/docs/provisioners/index.html).

## Example Usage

```
# Create a new instance of the ami-1234 on an m1.small node
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami = "ami-1234"
    instance_type = "m1.small"

    # optional tags (carefully note the ordering)
    tag {
        key = Customer
        value = "widgets inc."
    }
    tag {
        key = Name
        value = "web server"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ami` - (Required) The AMI to use for the instance.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The AZ to start the instance in.
* `instance_type` - (Required) The type of instance to start
* `key_name` - (Optional) The key name to use for the instance.
* `security_groups` - (Optional) A list of security group IDs or names to associate with.
   If you are within a VPC, you'll need to use the security group ID. Otherwise,
   for EC2, use the security group name.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The VPC Subnet ID to launch in.
* `associate_public_ip_address` - (Optional) Associate a public ip address with an instance in a VPC.
* `source_dest_check` - (Optional) Controls if traffic is routed to the instance when
  the destination address does not match the instance. Used for NAT or VPNs. Defaults false.
* `user_data` - (Optional) The user data to provide when launching the instance.
* `tag` - (Optional) Tags for the instance. NOTE: tags should be specified in alphabetical order of their keys, as keys are returned by Amazon in an arbitrary order and terraform sorts them in order to have a canonical representation.

* `id` - The instance ID.
